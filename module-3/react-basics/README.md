# React foundation

## step1: setup react project using vite tool

- inside src folder we keep all of our source code.
- main.jsx is the file that first runs.
- everytime npm run dev, is run on terminal, babel transpiles the code, to html, css and js that the browser understands.

## step2: creating a component

- 1. create a card component.
- 2. A Components first letter must be in capital.
- 3. Component, helps us in creating, maintaining and testable.
- 4. we write jsx, since we can club or bind html and js together in a single file.
- 5. each component must have a parent element. if no parent element then it throws an err.
- 6. diff between js and jsx is that, in jsx we can club js + html code together. and js only js code is allowed.

# How does jsx and babel works together?

- Babel is a transpiler, that transpiles react into html,css, js that browser understands.

# Best practices, 

- write jsx in Pascal case
- write functions in camelCase
- in react 17, we had to import react for all components, but this is not required now.
- vite has esbuild as transpiler.

# Attributes and Fragments.

- Fragmants are used to group html elements together.
- it does create or add a node in the dom.
