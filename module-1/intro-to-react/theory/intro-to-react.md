# Intro to React

- Its a open source JavaScript library developed by Facebook.
- Used to build Fast and interactive user interfaces.
- Popular for building single-page applications (SPAs).
- Efficient, flexible and component based.
- We can divide the application into components, so when we need to do some changes, we can easily do the changes at component level.

# Why React ? 

- Its most in demand technology that we have right now. and also community support is also more.
- Reusable components for consistent ui.
- Virtual DOM ensures faster rendering.
- Backed by Meta.
- Virtual DOM is a copy of acutal DOM.

# Component based Architecture

- Break the UI into smaller, reusable pieces (Components)
- Improves code reusability and maintainability.
- Example: Navbar, Sidebar, ProductCard.

# Declarative UI

- You describe what you want to see, not how to build it.
- React handles the DOM updates automatically.
- Makes code predictable and easier to debug
- in imperative approach, we would have to write whole logic all over again. and its very difficult to maintain and test as well using Vanilla JS.

# Single page application

- Loads only 1 HTML page and updates dynamically using JS.
- No Full page reload on navigation.
- React Router is used to handle routing.
- Results in Faster and smoother user experience.
